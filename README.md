# QookFast: The "Bento" Pipeline for converting FastQ files into a count matrix.

Got raw FastQ files but dreading the pipeline setup? I feel you. And the headache doesn't stop there—modern science demands your entire environment to be 100% reproducible. But here’s your ultimate hack: grab this preset template and spin up a fully automated, containerized RNA-seq pipeline. Absolute reproducibility, perfectly packed into one box, and ready to serve in just a few keystrokes. Launch your project with this one-liner pipeline, the data will be ready to go! Enjoy "qooking" biology!

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system (Note: These are already configured on the Room 3C shared desktop):
- **Git**: For version control.
- **Apptainer**: Required for containerized, reproducible execution.
- **Python 3 & pip**: Required to install the template engine.
- **Cookiecutter & jinja2-time**: Required for project configuration in QookFast.

**For macOS**

Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is the easiest way:
```bash
brew install git apptainer
pip install cookiecutter jinja2-time
```

**For Windows (WSL2 / Ubuntu)**

Run the following command to install all the prerequisites at once:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git apptainer python3 python3-pip
pip install cookiecutter jinja2-time
```

## User Guide
1. Run:
```bash
cookiecutter git@github.com:yo-aka-gene/QookFast.git
```

2. Answer the prompts to configure project details
    - `project_name`: name of the project
    - `description`: description for the project
    - `author_name`: the owner name (probably your name)
    - `email`: the owner contact
    - `species`: choose from `Homo_sapiens` or `Mus_musculus`
    - `read_length`: read length (default: `150`)
    - `read_type`: choose from `single_end` or `pair_end`
    - `threads`: thread numbers (default: `4`)
    - `strand`: choose from `unstranded`, `stranded`, or `rev-stranded`

:warning: **Note**: Parameters such as `read_length`, `read_type`, and `strand` vary depending on the sequencing platform used. Please verify these details prior to configuration.

You'll have a directory like this:
```
<your_project_name>/
    ├── align/
    │   └── (.bam files will be generated here)
    ├── counts/
    │   └── (count matrix will be generated here)
    ├── genome/
    │   ├── star_index/
    │   │   └── (STAR index files will be automatically generated here)
    │   └── (reference genome files are automatically downloaded here)
    ├── qc/
    │   └── (fastp outputs will be generated here)
    ├── raw_data/
    │   └── (manually move your .fastq.gz files here)
    ├── <your_project_name>.def
    ├── get_versions.sh
    ├── Makefile
    ├── README.md
    └── run_pipeline.sh
```

3. Run:
```bash
cd <your_project_directory>
make setup
```

4. Move all your `.fastq.gz` files into the `raw_data/` directory.
5. Run:
```
make run
```

### :octocat: Git and Large Files
- **Automatic Initialization**: `git init` is automatically performed upon project creation. You can start tracking your scripts immediately.
- **NEVER Push Large Files**: Do not add or push large biological data to GitHub. This includes:
    - Raw data (`raw_data/*.fastq.gz`)
    - Processed QC data (`qc/*.fastq.gz`)
    - Alignment files (`align/**/*.bam`)
    - Genome indices and FASTA files (`genome/*`)
- **Storage Limit**: GitHub has strict file size limits. If you accidentally attempt to push these files, the operation will fail and may corrupt your local environment's Git state.
